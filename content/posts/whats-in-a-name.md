How to decide on a name? 

I was intrigued by the idea of [Pointing and Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling) method that was invented to help station staff in Japan to remember what they need to check to ensure safety. This is the station staffs' "dance" that foreigners in Japan often amused about:

I thought of naming the app `pointcall` as one of the feature idea I have for the app is inspired by this method. My wife argued that the name should have something to do with `task` or `to-do`. Most people are not familiar with the concept of pointing and calling as something relevant to a to-do app. The app name should be easily associated with the concept of a reminder or to-do list.

At the same time, I want the domain that we reserve should use `.app` TLD, so I had to make sure the domain has not been taken. I dabbled with different combinations of "todo", "task", "reminder", "remember" synonyms by looking it up on [Thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/), and my [beloved domain name registrar](https://www.namecheap.com/). I thought it might be fun to use "forgetful" and `.me` TLD as in `forgetful.me` (luckily it was taken), but decided against using any negative words.

In the end, I thought of combining Japanese word for to-do (_yaru-koto_) with to-do: `yaru-koto-do`. Simplified to `kotodo`, it sounds just right. _Todo_ in Japanese also means sea lion. This opens up possibilities for a cute logo or mascot, so I am quite happy with this naming. _Ko-_ prefix usually means "Little", so _kotodo_ could mean "Little Sea Lion" or even a cute "Little Todo App".
