My new year's resolution for 2019 is to publish a to-do app on iOS App Store. I know there are countless of to-do apps out there already, why does anybody need yet another to-do app? I believe that there are still plenty of room to grow for a to-do app. I also happen to have some brilliant ideas. Even if they don't turn out to be brilliant, I can learn many things in the process. I'm hoping to document the process in this blog. Happy New Year!
