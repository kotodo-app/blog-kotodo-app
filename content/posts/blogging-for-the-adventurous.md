Static site blogging is all the rage recently. Is doing it makes a great content? Obviously not. If creating a great content is to be the objective, `WordPress` is probably your best bet. But if the objective is having fun learning when time is on your side, then trying out blogging platforms even before start blogging could be a great excuse for not writing actual contents. Like what Taro Aso would said:

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="kOHqrSK"><a href="//imgur.com/kOHqrSK"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Actually, [he didn't really say that](http://japan.kantei.go.jp/asospeech/2009/06/17message_e.html). Anyway, in the spirit of "to boldly go where lots of other people have gone before", I'm going on an adventure. 

## Traditional Blogging Platform

I'm going to try the traditional ones out:

1. Hosted
  1. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/). The one that started it all.
  1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). The one that rules world.
  1. [LiveJournal](https://www.livejournal.com/). The one that I thought died a peaceful death, but they're still alive!
  1. [Medium](https://medium.com/). The one that everyone thought was a good idea, but apparently not anymore.
  1. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/). The one that nobody sure what it is.
  1. [Tumlbr](https://www.tumblr.com/). The one with porn in it, but not anymore.
  1. [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/). The one with minimalistic design.
  1. [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/). The one for rich folks with some money sto spare.
1. Self-Hosted (Dynamic)
  1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). The `PHP` code base has been around forever, so there be dragons.
  1. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). `Node.js`-based code, so it's supposedly kind of modern.

## Static Page Generator
  
Static page generators is the old ways that became new again. It's the [handlebar moustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handlebar_moustache) of blogging. It's the Internet hipsters' platform of choice:

1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's in `Ruby`, which I kind of dislike without any reasonable justification. But [I gave it a try anyway](http://mamad.purbo.org/).
2. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It's in `Go`, which I kind of like without any reasonable justification. 
3. [Next](https://nextjs.org/). It's in `Node.js`! With `React.js`! It's every hipsters' wet dream.
3. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It's in `Node.js`! With `React.js`! It's another hipsters' wet dream.

We can self-host the site, or let some services [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) it for us, for free or for a price:

1. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This blog is currently hosted here for free. CI/CD through [Github](https://github.com/kotodo-app/blog-kotodo-app).
2. [Forestry](https://forestry.io/). I tried using this for the CMS, but Markdown is better.

I'm partial to one of these self-hosted static page generators. They're low cost with too many delightful distractions. In fact, I temporarily publish this blog with [one of those](https://gohugo.io/). But let's see, I might get tired with distractions.
