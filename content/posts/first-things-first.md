Where to start to make a to-do app? Obviously there are too much tasks to do to fit in one own's head at one time, so we need a way to organize them. One way to start organizing is to make a table of things to-do in the order of whatever comes to mind first and repeat. So that's what we would do. Table it is.

| No | Task | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| 1  | Decide on a name. | Done. We decided it will be named: `Kotodo`. |
| 2  | Reserve a domain. | Done. [`.app`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.app_(gTLD)) is a new top-level domain for branding mobile, web, and other applications, so it seems appropriate to reserve `kotodo.app` for the name that we decided. |
| 3  | Start a blog. | In progress. We want to document the process, and a blog is suitable media for that. |
| 4  | Decide on a blogging platform and host. | In progress. |
| 5  | Do a survey (comparative research) on existing to-do apps for science. | Need to do this to see what features we like/don't like from existing apps. |
| 6  | Listing up essential features that are in all/some other to-do apps. | Also need to make notes on the possibilities of improving the features provided by other apps. |
| 7  | Listing up our wish-list on what features we would like to have in a to-do apps that is not currently in other apps. | This is obviously our own well-guarded trade secret that we wouldn't document publicly. Just in case our ideas really are brilliant. |
| 8  | Make a blueprint, UI and application flow ideas. | In order to do this, we also need to study what options out there are available to do this task. |
| 9  | Make a mock UIs and/or application prototype, redesign, iterate to improve. | This is a prototype that we can try and feel to make sure that the features we want really are something worthwile. |

To be continued. These are plenty of things to do already, so we're going to start with this.
