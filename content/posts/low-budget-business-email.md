Now that we have reserved the domain and set up a blog, to help us getting into the mindset of starting up something big, we really should start to make our presence in the social media. To register social media accounts we need a mail account, preferably with our domain `kotodo.app` like a pro.

What are our options?

| No | Option | Pros | Cons |
|----|--------|------|------|
| 1 | Set up our own email server. | <ul><li>Fun.</li><li>Practically free (if you already have a server running somewhere, which [I do](http://mamad.purbo.org/), running droplets at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/).</li><li>A chance to learn so many potentially soon-to-be-useless knowledge.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Configuring and maintaining a robust spam-free email is hard.</li><li>So much time wasted for tinkering, probably better spent doing other things.</li></ul> |
| 2 | Use shared hosting plans from providers such as [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/web-hosting) (I've used them, they're pretty good) or [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared). | <ul><li>At less than 3$/month, they're the most cheap options if you don't have a host for your web sites as well.</li><li>Easy setup, most provides web interface for all the stuff you need in a hosting service.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Less fun.</li><li>Somewhat limited customizability and scalability, though I'm sure the support will help you with that to keep you stay.</li></ul> |
| 3 | Use email hosting service provided by your registrar if they have. ([ours](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/email.aspx) does). | <ul><li>At less than 10$/year for one mailbox it's cheap.</li><li>Setup is literally some clicks away.</li></ul> | <ul><li>None really, if you're willing to spend that 10$/year.</li></ul> |
| 4 | Use email forwarding service. | <ul><li>Some registrars ([ours](https://www.namecheap.com/) does) provide it for free.</li></ul> | <ul><li>You will need to have another email address to forward to (e.g. Gmail).</li><li>Receive only, unable to send.</li><li>Too limited, not really an option for a real business.</li></ul> |
| 5 | Use a full-blown mailbox service (like [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) ir [Zoho Workplace](https://www.zoho.com/workplace/pricing.html?src=zmail)). | <ul><li>Peace of mind.</li><li>Unlimited scalability.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Naturally the most expensive option, but really, at around 50$/year for one mailbox, it's worth the price.</li></ul> |

Since we're just started and we already have some servers running, I was going to do **Option 1**. But I was lazy, so I went with **Option 4** instead. It's free, one-click away, and we have some addresses now! 

Unfortunately we can only receive email for now. It's literally the dog logic of emails:
